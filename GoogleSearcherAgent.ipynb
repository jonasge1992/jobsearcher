    "    in the data science domain. Do not parallelize any function calls. Always wait for the output from user_proxy before proceeding with the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Previously Searched Companies**: Use `call_searched_companies` to get the list of companies that were already searched. \n",
    "Avoid these companies throughout your tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search for Remote Companies**: Search Google for \"fully remote companies\". Adjust the query if necessary. \n",
    "Extract the HTML text from the first link, and if it fails, try another link after waiting at least 15 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify Remote Companies**: From the extracted text, identify and list companies that are noted for remote work. The companies have to be separated\n",
    "by two |\n",
    "List only the company names, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare previously searched companies and possible remote companies** To identify companys that still remain un-searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find Career Sites**: For each company that has not yet been searched, search Google by performing 'fetch_top_search_results'\n",
    "with the query \"{company_name} career site\". Select the most likely link to be the company's career site. If none are suitable, \n",
    "proceed to the next company.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scrape Career Sites**: Use the `scrape_career_website` tool to extract all text from the identified career site by querying its url.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Identify Relevant Job Positions**: From the scraped text, identify open positions related to data science, data engineering,\n",
    "or data analysis. Only include job titles such as \"Data Scientist\", \"Data Analyst\", \"Data Engineer\", or similar roles. \n",
    "Do not include roles like \"Software Engineer - Data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Store Jobs**: Store the identified job positions into the GLOBAL_DATAFRAME with the company and URL by performing 'store_jobs_in_global_df'.\n",
    "\n",
    "1-8 Is a loop. After you are done with that loop follow the next steps. Do this loop 2 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Save Results**: At the end of the process, save the results into a CSV file using the `store_jobs_in_csv` function. \n",
    "This step should only be done once and at the very end of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Termination**: Once all tasks are completed successfully, return 'TERMINATE'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, do not parallelize the workflow. Follow the steps sequentially and if any step fails, check the previous output to decide the next action.\n",

Wonderlic’s mission is to help HR professionals identify top applicants and predict on-the-job performance by providing them with the most trusted, scientifically validated assessments on the market. Since the company was founded in 1937, more than 200 million Wonderlic assessments have been administered to job candidates. Our formula for success is simple: cutting-edge I/O psychology research, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and a company culture grounded in a thirst for innovative thinking and a sincere respect for diverse perspectives. Here’s why thousands of companies rely on Wonderlic’s unique \"whole person” assessments to identify the best fits for every open role, hire with confidence, and more. 1. Reduce turnover By identifying candidates who have the skills, temperament, and motivation needed to succeed in their role within your organization, Wonderlic significantly reduces turnover. We’ve helped our clients reduce turnover by up to 44%. 2. Create a more equitable hiring process and culture The objective candidate data we provide allows hiring teams to see whether candidates have what it takes to excel, regardless of their work experience or level of education. This data-driven assessment approach helps organizations mitigate the unconscious bias inherent in the hiring process—and create more diverse, equitable, and inclusive teams. 3. Streamline your hiring process By using WonScore to pre-screen candidates, you can cut your applicant review time by up to 50%—and quickly focus on your highest-potential candidates before they get snapped up by a competitor. 4. Deliver a first-class candidate experience Unlike most assessment companies, Wonderlic offers candidate feedback reports that provide candidates with curated insights into their score. In addition, our assessment provides new hire success tips for a better understanding of a candidate’s personality, motivators, and learning potential. 5. Build a future-proof workforce As new technologies transform the job landscape, more and more companies are focused on finding employees with the ability to learn new skills, adjust to change, and thrive in the face of uncertainty. Our competency-based insights also help companies get a clearer sense of candidates’ capacity for development and long-term growth.| | | | | | See all jobs | | View profile | | |Zone & Co| |Fintech • Professional Services • Software • Consulting| |Fully Remote| |We are a premier NetSuite Partner & Developer helping high-growth companies automate advanced billing & revenue in NetSuite.

Wonderlic’s mission is to help HR professionals identify top applicants and predict on-the-job performance by providing them with the most trusted, scientifically validated assessments on the market. Since the company was founded in 1937, more than 200 million Wonderlic assessments have been administered to job candidates. Our formula for success is simple: cutting-edge I/O psychology research, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and a company culture grounded in a thirst for innovative thinking and a sincere respect for diverse perspectives. Here’s why thousands of companies rely on Wonderlic’s unique \"whole person” assessments to identify the best fits for every open role, hire with confidence, and more. 1. Reduce turnover By identifying candidates who have the skills, temperament, and motivation needed to succeed in their role within your organization, Wonderlic significantly reduces turnover. We’ve helped our clients reduce turnover by up to 44%. 2. Create a more equitable hiring process and culture The objective candidate data we provide allows hiring teams to see whether candidates have what it takes to excel, regardless of their work experience or level of education. This data-driven assessment approach helps organizations mitigate the unconscious bias inherent in the hiring process—and create more diverse, equitable, and inclusive teams. 3. Streamline your hiring process By using WonScore to pre-screen candidates, you can cut your applicant review time by up to 50%—and quickly focus on your highest-potential candidates before they get snapped up by a competitor. 4. Deliver a first-class candidate experience Unlike most assessment companies, Wonderlic offers candidate feedback reports that provide candidates with curated insights into their score. In addition, our assessment provides new hire success tips for a better understanding of a candidate’s personality, motivators, and learning potential. 5. Build a future-proof workforce As new technologies transform the job landscape, more and more companies are focused on finding employees with the ability to learn new skills, adjust to change, and thrive in the face of uncertainty. Our competency-based insights also help companies get a clearer sense of candidates’ capacity for development and long-term growth.| | | | | | See all jobs | | View profile | | |Zone & Co| |Fintech • Professional Services • Software • Consulting| |Fully Remote| |We are a premier NetSuite Partner & Developer helping high-growth companies automate advanced billing & revenue in NetSuite.
